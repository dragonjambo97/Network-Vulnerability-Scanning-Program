Introduction:
The project involves creating a network vulnerability scanning tool that identifies open ports and associated services for a given IP address or domain. The tool is written in Python and utilizes various libraries such as socket, nmap, and BeautifulSoup.

Project Objective:
The goal of the project is to create a simple application that allows users to identify potential security gaps in network systems and services, which can contribute to increasing the level of network security.

Functionalities Description:
The program offers the following functionalities:

Retrieving the IP address based on the input domain.
Scanning open ports for the selected IP address.
Displaying information about services associated with open ports.
Interacting with various Python libraries, such as socket, nmap, requests, and BeautifulSoup.
Program Workflow:
The user inputs the domain they want to investigate as an argument in the command line. The program then performs the following steps:
Determines the IP address associated with the provided domain using the socket library.
Scans open ports for that IP address using the nmap library.
Displays device information using the BeautifulSoup library to process the web page associated with the IP address.
Displays a list of open ports and their corresponding services.
Testing and Results:
The program was tested on various domains such as python.org. The obtained results were consistent with expectations and showed open ports and their associated services for the given IP address. For the domain python.org, the program returned the following information:
IP address: 151.101.1.168
Open ports:
Port 80: http
Port 443: https
Conclusion:
The network vulnerability scanning program fulfills its purpose, identifying open ports and their associated services for a selected IP address or domain. The application can be useful for network administrators who want to monitor their systems for potential security gaps. Further development of this tool could include integration with vulnerability databases and the introduction of a graphical user interface.
